# TrafficSign_FCN
## Traffic Sign Classification using Fully Convolutional Networks with Configurable parameters

Train a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with 3 Convolutional layers (including 2 pooling layers) and a global average pooling layer just befor classifier layer for traffic signs classification.

Batch Normalization and Relu activation function both are used on Convolution layers respectively.

Change parameters in `Config.py` and train using `python3 train.py`
Change Paths of Train and Test data in Config file.

##Requirements:
* torch
* Pillow
* numpy
